# CMSE-202-Project

### How to Run
- Open folder in jupyter notebook
- Habitable Exoplanets.ipynb is the main notebook
- habitable_zone_plot.py is the plotting function that visualizes systems
- Kepler.csv 

### Goal
- Approximate the amount of planets in our galaxy that are habitable. 
    - The problem is that not every planet has been found and researched, so we need to approximate based on the data that already exists.
- Making a function using the data (such as distance from the star and total mass) to determine the habitability of each planet in the data set.
- Extrapolate to get a rough estimate of what the total amount may be, a sort of Fermi estimation.

### Contributions By Team Members
- Collin: Created exoplanet class and packaged all rows into exoplanet objects, also made habitable_zone_plot.py
- Alexis: Cleaned Dataset and created arrays
- Mickey: Made edits to exoplanet class to assist with data processing and made pie charts along with histograms at end.
- Sydney and Emma: Made slides and made contributions to data processing
