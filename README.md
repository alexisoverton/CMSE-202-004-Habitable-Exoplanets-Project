# CMSE-202-Project


- Approximate the amount of planets in our galaxy that are habitable. 
    - The problem is that not every planet has been found and researched, so we need to approximate based on the data that already exists.
- Making a function using the data (such as distance from the star and total mass) to determine the habitability of each planet in the data set.
-  Extrapolate to get a rough estimate of what the total amount may be, a sort of Fermi estimation.
